                <div class="des">As the only child, I grew up with the unique experience of having the undivided attention and love of my parents. While this meant I had to learn to entertain myself at times, it also allowed me to develop a strong sense of independence and self-reliance. Being the center of their world, I formed a deep bond with my family and cherished the quality time we spent together. This experience shaped me into someone who values close relationships, while also appreciating the solitude that allows for personal growth.</div>

                  Growing up plump and cute, I was often showered with affection and playful teasing from family and friends. My round cheeks and chubby smile became part of my charm, and I embraced the carefree nature of childhood, where food and fun were always at the center of it all. While my appearance sparked many endearing comments, it also taught me to love myself just the way I was. Over the years, I learned to balance the joy of indulging with the importance of staying healthy, all while holding onto the confidence that came from feeling comfortable in my own skin.</div>
